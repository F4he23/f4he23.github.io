## Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning model designed to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. By analyzing medical features from biopsy data, this model serves as a diagnostic support tool for healthcare professionals. The goal is to enhance cancer detection accuracy and improve patient care through AI-driven tumor classification.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Breast Cancer Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/F4he23/Brest-Cancer-Prediction.git
   cd Brest-Cancer-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**:
   You can find the dataset in the `data` folder. If it's not included, please check the "Releases" section for download links.

4. **Run the model**:
   Execute the following command to run the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Features

- **Classification**: Classifies tumors as benign or malignant.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the dataset.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates F1 Score, Precision, Recall Score, and ROC Curve.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.

## Data

The dataset consists of various medical features derived from breast biopsy samples. Each sample is labeled as either benign or malignant. Key features include:

- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Symmetry
- Fractal Dimension

Data is crucial for training the model effectively. Make sure to preprocess the data appropriately before training.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics:

- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall Score**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
- **ROC Curve**: A graphical representation of the model's performance across different thresholds.

### Sample Evaluation Code

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, roc_curve

# Assuming y_true and y_pred are defined
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)

print(f"F1 Score: {f1}")
print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
```

## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Load your dataset in the appropriate format.
2. Train the model using the training data.
3. Evaluate the model using the test data.
4. Make predictions on new data.
